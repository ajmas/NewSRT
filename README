These are files needed to compile an executable to run the "New" SRT

see http://www.haystack.mit.edu/edu/undergrad/srt/index.html

there is a script  named srtnmake to compile:


#!/bin/bash
CFLAGS=`pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags`
LIBS=`pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --libs`
gcc -W -Wall -O3 $CFLAGS $LIBS main.c disp.c plot.c cat.c geom.c time.c outfile.c sport.c map.c cmdfl.c cal.c srthelp.c velspec.c  amdfft.c -lm  -lacml /usr/lib/libgfortran.a 
cp a.out srtn

The drivers for the ADC card  are in  PCI-DAS4020-12.1.21.tgz

This code is "preliminary" and currently only supports the old SRT controller
for antenna control.

The FFT runs on an AMD CPU and this software needs libgfortran.a and libacml.so (as there maybe problems
with the fortran library on the PC.) The fortran is only needed for AMDs cfft1d called in amdfft.c
60-mcc.rules is needed for the ADC card as well as the drivers in PCI-DAS4020-12.1.21.tgz

I hope that when and if someone decides to build the New srt receiver (which itself needs no software)
and decides to use the DAS4020-12 PCI ADC card and antenna mount controller from Alpha or rfhamdesign
I will be available to help with hardware and software issues. At present Haystack has no funds to support
further SRT development and so any assistance will have to be on a "best effort" basis.
